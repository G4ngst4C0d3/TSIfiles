How much attention do you pay to TV broadcasting? Every day when
you turn on the TV you receive lots of information from several networks.
Among a variety of headlines, some of them may keep you watching it for
some time. Depending on the day, some affiliates tend to look for the most
unusual breaking news and try to have live shots during the programs
they present.
The news that seems to keep calling people’s attention most frequently
are the ones about disasters and how people involved in it were rescued.
Rescue teams are the key of every action when people get in trouble. They
make the decisions and start operating immediately after receiving the
distress signal.
There are five types of rescues: mountain rescue; ground search and
rescue; urban search and rescue; combat search and rescue, air-sea
rescue. As its own name explains, Mountain Rescue is about searching
and rescuing operations mostly in mountainous terrain.
When it comes to Ground Search and Rescue, people who work on it search
for people that are lost or distressed for any reason, but mainly because
of wandering behavior due to Alzheimer’s disease, autism and dementia,
among others

Water skiing and climbing the side of a building are exciting enough for you?
Imagine having these actions as part of your career.  If so, maybe being a
stunt may be a good option for you. However, being a stunt is not about
taking risks, but about managing them and staying physically healthy.
Developing skills and  specializing can definitely help you. If you are an
expert martial artist, gymnast or rock climber, that is great. But the more
you know how to do it, the higher the probabilities that you will be selected
for a job. Some roles require multiple skills, such as fighting, falling, riding
and driving, agility and strength, water skills and several sports. Consider
going to school for specialized training is a very interesting option if you
want to improve your skill set.

Knowing the terms associated with the career is very important, because
if a stunt director starts talking about the job with you, you may know what
he means. Among the main important terms there are wirework, tumbling,
high falls, swordplay, horsework and air ram.
Build your résumé and remember the most important thing: be honest. Do
nottry to impress people by saying you have skills you do notreally possess,
otherwise you will be in trouble, even in danger. Your height, weight, shoe
size, and any other physical measurements, film and TV credits (if you have
any) and a list of skills or special abilities are some elements that should
be included on your résumé. You may also have a professional black and
white headshot taken and join a Union that is going to represent you and
fight for your rights. That might be mentioned in your résumé as well.
If you get lucky, you can set a gig with a great headshot and impressive
résumé on a non-union project. But if you want to hit the big leagues
and find work on a union project, then you have to obtain a production
list from the union you belong to. These lists contain all of the local union
productions that are shooting near you and all you have to do is send your
headshot and résumé to the stunts coordinator and hope for a phone call
asking: Are you ready to start?
