How much attention do you pay to TV broadcasting? Every day when
you turn on the TV you receive lots of information from several networks.
Among a variety of headlines, some of them may keep you watching it for
some time. Depending on the day, some affiliates tend to look for the most
unusual breaking news and try to have live shots during the programs
they present.
The news that seems to keep calling people’s attention most frequently
are the ones about disasters and how people involved in it were rescued.
Rescue teams are the key of every action when people get in trouble. They
make the decisions and start operating immediately after receiving the
distress signal.
